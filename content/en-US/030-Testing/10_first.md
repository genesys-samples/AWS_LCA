## Explore QNABot Builder
QnABot on AWS is a multi-channel, multi-language conversational interface (chatbot) that responds to your customerâ€™s questions, answers, and feedback. It allows you to deploy a fully functional chatbot across multiple channels including chat, voice, SMS, and Amazon Alexa. The dashboard that you have access to allows you to customize the questions, answers and feedback that the QNABot will run on your interactions. 

Let's create a new question and answer in our QNABot Builder. Follow these steps: 

- In your QNABot Dashboard, press add
- Ensure that the type is set to qna
- Fill in a valid ItemID
- Provide some questions that a customer would ask for your use case (see the example down below for tracking a package)
- Provide the answer that you want to be surfaced to agents when this question is asked
